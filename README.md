# Apple Color Determinant
Application that is guessing color of apple from image

1) Install Pillow, sklearn and numpy, using command for your package manager.
2) Put picture of single apple without leafs on white or black background (or close to white or black) in directory named "images"(or you can change it). This directory already have few images by which the neural network learned.
3) After starting the program write the name of picture with extension and without path to script or directory.
